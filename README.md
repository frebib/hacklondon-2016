# The Airbourne Ultimatum :: HackLondon 2016
In 24 hours we made a game in which the player has to infect the entire world with a limited budget by flying to various countries determined by flight data obtained using [skyscanner](www.skyscanner.net)'s flight data API

You can play at [https://theairbourneultimatum.net](https://theairbourneultimatum.net)

The game is built using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) for the server backend and rendered with [D3](https://d3js.org/) and [Topojson](https://github.com/mbostock/topojson) for the planet topography.
